# 👋 Hi, I'm Kalyan Vinayak

I'm a passionate developer and tech enthusiast focused on solving real-world problems through innovative software-hardware integration. From creating intelligent navigation systems using A* algorithm and Arduino to building AI-powered disaster management apps with Flutter, Firebase, and Google Cloud, I love turning complex ideas into meaningful, working solutions.

## 🚀 What I Do

- 🔧 **IoT & Embedded Systems**  
  Built a smart city navigation system using Arduino, LCDs, shift registers, and LED matrices. Sent optimized A* path data from C++ to Arduino via serial communication and visualized the route dynamically.

- 📱 **Mobile App Development (Flutter)**  
  Currently developing a **dual-interface disaster management app** for civilians and government agencies. Key features include:
  - AI-powered disaster prediction (earthquake, cyclone)
  - Real-time SOS alert system
  - Rescue team tracking via GPS-enabled wearables
  - Firebase-based inventory and resource management
  - Push notifications using FCM
  - Mesh networking (planned) for emergency offline communication

- 🧠 **AI/ML Integration**  
  Integrated APIs and models to predict natural disasters, enhance inventory logistics, and support intelligent alert systems. Passionate about expanding ML applications into public safety tech.

- 🌐 **Cloud & Backend Tools**  
  Proficient with Firebase (Auth, Firestore, FCM), Google Cloud Platform, and GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
