## 🚀 What I Do

- 🔧 **IoT & Embedded Systems (ECE + CSE Hybrid)**  
  Built a smart city navigation system using Arduino, LED matrices, shift registers, and LCDs. Used A* algorithm for pathfinding, and seamlessly integrated C++ logic with real-time serial communication for dynamic hardware control.

- 📱 **Mobile App Development (Flutter)**  
  Developing a **government + civilian disaster management app** with:
  - AI-based disaster prediction (earthquake, cyclone)
  - Real-time SOS alert & rescue team tracking
  - Firebase-based inventory and push notifications
  - Wearable hardware integration using ESP, GPS, and LoRa
  - Offline mesh networking (coming soon)

- 🧠 **AI/ML & Cloud**  
  Integrating ML models & APIs for disaster forecasting and smart alert systems. Using **Firebase**, **GCP**, and **Gemini AI** for backend intelligence.

- 👨‍💻 **Competitive Programming**  
  - 🛡️ **Knight Badge on LeetCode**
  - 📈 **Codeforces Max Rating: 1222**
  - Solid problem-solving skills in **C++** and strong grasp of algorithms and data structures.
  - Frequently participate in contests and enjoy tackling algorithmic challenges.

- 🤝 **Open Source Enthusiast**  
  Always open to contributing to meaningful projects, learning from the community, and building together.
